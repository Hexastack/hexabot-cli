## Example Workflow

1. **Create a new project**:

   ```sh
   hexabot create my-chatbot
   ```

   This will create a new folder `my-chatbot` with all necessary files to get started.

2. **Navigate to your project folder**:

   ```sh
   cd my-chatbot
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Initialize environment**:

   ```sh
   hexabot init
   ```

   This command copies the `.env.example` file to `.env`, which you can edit to customize your configuration.

5. **Run in development mode**:

   ```sh
   hexabot dev --services nlu,ollama
   ```

   This starts the required services in development mode.
